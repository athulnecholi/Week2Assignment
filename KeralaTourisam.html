                Kerala (English: /ˈkɛrələ/ ⓘ/ KERR-ə-lə), called Keralam in Malayalam (Malayalam: [keːɾɐɭɐm] ⓘ), is a
                state on the Malabar Coast of India.[15] It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the
                States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin,
                Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore.[16][17] Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st
                largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the
                east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea[18] to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011
                census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the
                capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official
                language of the state.[19]

                The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and
                the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE).
                The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE.[20] The region's prominence in trade was
                noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade
                attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the
                time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in
                Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region,
                in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later
                became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the
                modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur
                taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the
                taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi
                (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).[17]
